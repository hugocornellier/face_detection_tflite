- Increase frame skip (1/4 or 1/5) when using Full mode
- Use **Front** or **Short** model for close faces
- Use **Full Range** for distant faces

## Color Customization (Still Image Only)

Default visualization colors:
- 🟦 **Cyan** - Bounding boxes
- 🔵 **Light Blue** - Landmarks (6 points)
- 🌸 **Baby Pink** - Face mesh (468 points)
- 🔷 **Blue** - Iris ovals and eye contours

All colors are customizable via the color picker.

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Check camera permissions in app settings
- Restart the app
- Try different camera (front/back)

### Low FPS
- Switch to Fast mode
- Increase frame skip to 1/5
- Use Front or Short model for close faces

### Faces Not Detected
- Ensure good lighting
- Check if faces are visible and unobstructed
- Try Full Range or Full Sparse model
- Ensure faces are roughly front-facing

### High Detection Times (Still Image)
- Disable unused features
- Use appropriate model (don't use Full Range for selfies)
- Consider image resolution (very large images are slower)
